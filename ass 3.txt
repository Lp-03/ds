import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df=pd.read_csv("Employee_2.csv")
df

summary_stats = df.groupby("Age")[["Salary"]].agg(["mean", "median", "min", "max", "std"])
summary_list = summary_stats.values.tolist()
print(summary_stats)

plt.hist(data=df,x='Age')
